    </h5>
    <p>The Ministry of Tourism has a scheme for granting approval to hotel projects from the point of view of this
        suitability for international tourists. A classification committee set up by the Ministry classifies the
        functioning hotels under the star system into six categories from star one to five star deluxe. Similarly, the
        Ministry has a scheme of approving Travel Agents, Tour Operators, Adventure Tour Operators and Tourist Transport
        Operators, the idea being to encourage quality, standard and service in these categories so as to promote
        Tourism in India.This is a voluntary scheme open to all bonafide agencies. <br>
        <br><strong>Travel Agents</strong> <br>
        <br> A Travel Agent is one who makes arrangements of tickets for travel by air, rail, ship, passport, visa, etc. It may also arrange accommodation, tours, entertainment and other tourism related services.
